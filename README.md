# VBA-challenge
Hello viewer and welcome to my submission for Challenge 2 aka the VBA-challenge.
For context, at the time of writing this, I am enrolled in the Data Analytics and Visualizations bootcamp with the University of MN. We are assigned a challenge homework per module. This is Module 2's challenge on Visual Basics for Applications. I am using a windows/PC laptop. 


In this specific challenge, we were given a workbook with multi-year stock data and a reference photo for how the first worksheet (2018) should look once completed. The challenge was to create a VBA script that would loop through all the worksheets in the workbook to gather and output the following information: ticker symbol, yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume of the stock. We were also challenged to add conditional functions. 
I was unable to add the excel workbook itself as the file size is too large. Hopefully the screenshots will suffice.
In this submission, you will find: 3 screenshots of the worksheets in the workbook organized by year (2018, 2019, 2020), a text file with my macro, and the reference images.
The text file with my macro includes comments on my thought process for writing my macro.
Please note that I used a lovely website referenced below to find the code to fill some of my cells with color. Otherwise, everything else was retained information gathered from my classes and class activities. 

Big shout out to my bootcamp TAs Sam and Randy for all their help answering my questions regarding GitHub and repositories during office hours, my instructor Hunter for always being clear in his articulation of the course material, and my classmates for their encouragement and support.
